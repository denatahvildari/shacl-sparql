The jar file "exec/validation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" is the implementation used for the experiments reported in the article "Validating SHACL constraints over a SPARQL endpoint", submitted at ISWC 2019.
It performs validation of an RDF graph exposed as a SPARQL endpoint against SHACL shapes.
The source code is available in folder "source", the shapes used for the experiments are available in folder "data/shapes", and the SPARQL queries used as a baseline (for non-recursive shapes) are available in forder "data/queries".


To use the validator:
java -jar validation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [-g <graphName>] -s <shapeDirectory> <endpointUrl> <outputDir>

where:
- <graphName> is the (optional) name of the graph. If specified, the generated queries will use the SPARQL GRAPH keyword.
- <shapeDirectory> is the folder containing the shapes to be validated.
There must be one json file per shape, following the syntax described by the document "jsonSyntax.pdf".
- <shapeDirectory> is the url of the sparql endpoint.
- <outputDir> is the output directory. It will contain logs and the validation results.

Java 8 is required.

For instance:
java -jar validation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -s ./data/shapes/nonRec/2/ "http://dbpedia.org/sparql"  ./shapes/nonRec/2/output

Note that the validation results for the above command are erroneous, because the SPARQL endpoint "http://dbpedia.org/sparql" only returns the 10 000 first answers to a query.
